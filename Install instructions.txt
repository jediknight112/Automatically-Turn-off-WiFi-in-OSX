**This version is compatible with Mac OSX, even the most recent versions**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you already have this install and are on El Capitan or plan to update to El Capitan run this to remove the old version:

sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist; sudo rm /Library/Scripts/NetBasics/wireless.sh; sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to install

1. Copy the 2 files "wireless.sh" and "com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist" to your Desktop.

*** If you don't want to do steps 2-8 line by line skip to the bottom and run the one liner, it will do all the things for you. ***

2. Make the directory of "NetBasics/" using this in shell:
        sudo mkdir -p /Library/Scripts/NetBasics/

3. Move the "wireless.sh" file into that directory with this:
        sudo mv ~/Desktop/wireless.sh /Library/Scripts/NetBasics/

4. Make sure the file permissions are correct with this:
        sudo chmod 755 /Library/Scripts/NetBasics/wireless.sh

5. Make the directory of "LaunchDaemons/" with this:
        sudo mkdir -p /Library/LaunchDaemons/

6. Move the "com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist" file into that directory with this:
        sudo mv ~/Desktop/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist

7. This file needs to be owned by the user "root" and in the group "wheel" for it to work, run this to do so:
        sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist

8. You can either reboot your computer or run this to load the .plist:
        sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist



Alternatively you can run this one liner and it does all of the things a once after you copy the files to your desktop:

       sudo mkdir -p /Library/Scripts/NetBasics/ && sudo mv ~/Desktop/wireless.sh /Library/Scripts/NetBasics/ && sudo chmod 755 /Library/Scripts/NetBasics/wireless.sh && sudo mkdir -p /Library/LaunchDaemons/ && sudo mv ~/Desktop/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist && sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist && sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.computernetworkbasics.wifionoff.plist
